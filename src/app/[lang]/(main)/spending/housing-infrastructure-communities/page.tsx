							When HICC was founded in FY 2005 as the Office of Infrastructure
							Canada, the department's spending has grown from $250,000 to over
							$14 billion, a significant increase in overall spending and

							Major legislation, internal or global economic conditions, and
							acute events like the COVID-19 pandemic can significantly
							influence government spending year to year. For instance, during
							the pandemic, the Government of Canada's total expenses rose from
							$410.2 billion in 2019 to $420 billion in 2020 and further to
							$720.3 billion in 2021.

							Similarly, HICC expenditures experienced notable fluctuations
