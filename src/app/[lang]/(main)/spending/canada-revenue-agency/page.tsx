							The Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) is the federal institution
							responsible for administering tax laws, enforcing compliance, and
							delivering key benefit programs to individuals and businesses
							across Canada. Established in 1999 under the Canada Revenue Agency
							Act, the CRA operates with a workforce of approximately 59,155
							employees (2024) and oversees tax revenues totaling $379 billion
							annuallyâ€”which accounts for over 82% of federal revenues. It also
							administers over $46 billion in benefits and credits to Canadians,
							including the Canada Child Benefit and the GST/HST credit.
