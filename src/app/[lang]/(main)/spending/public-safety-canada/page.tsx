							Public Safety, Democratic Institutions and Intergovernmental
							Affairs Canada (Public Safety Canada) is the federal department
							responsible for national security, emergency preparedness, and
							community safety. Established in 2003, it consolidates security,
							law enforcement, and emergency management functions. It includes
							the RCMP, CSIS, and CBSA and coordinates federal responses to
							threats and develops policies on crime prevention, cyber
							resilience, and disaster preparedness while overseeing
							intelligence-sharing with domestic and international partners.

						<Trans>How has Public Safety Canada's spending changed?</Trans>
					</H2>
					<P>
						<Trans>
							Federal spending on public safety fluctuates based on evolving
							security threats, emergency events, and changes in government
							policy. Since 2005 shortly after it was established, Public Safety
							Canada's expenditures have increased by 69.6%, reflecting
							heightened investments in counterterrorism, cyber defence, and
							disaster response capabilities. The department's share of the
							federal budget has remained relatively flat from 2.6% in 2005 to
							2.7% in 2024.
						</Trans>
					</P>
					<P>
						<Trans>
							Major policy shifts, unforeseen events such as natural disasters,
							and global security concerns can significantly impact the
							department's annual spending. The COVID-19 pandemic, for example,
							led to a sharp increase in federal emergency response funding in
							2020.
