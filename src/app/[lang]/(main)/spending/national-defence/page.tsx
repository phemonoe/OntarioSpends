							The Department of National Defence (DND) and the Canadian Armed
							Forces (CAF) are responsible for ensuring Canada's security and
							defence through military operations, infrastructure management,
							and personnel support. Established in 1923 under the National
							Defence Act, DND oversees the defence budget, military
							procurement, and readiness planning, while the CAF executes
							domestic and international operations. The department provides
							strategic defence policy guidance and works with international
							allies, including NATO and NORAD, to ensure national security. DND
							also administers military health services, housing programs, and
							recruitment initiatives to support its personnel.
