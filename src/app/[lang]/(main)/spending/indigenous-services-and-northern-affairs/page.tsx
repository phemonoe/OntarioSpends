							Indigenous Services Canada (ISC) and Crown-Indigenous Relations
							and Northern Affairs Canada (CIRNAC) are two distinct federal
							departments tasked with advancing Indigenous priorities in Canada.
							Established in 2017 following the dissolution of Indigenous and
							Northern Affairs Canada (INAC), these departments manage different
							aspects of Indigenous policy, service delivery, and governance.

						<Trans>
							ISC is responsible for providing essential services to First
							Nations, Inuit, and MÃ©tis communities, including healthcare,
							education, housing, and child and family services. It also works
							to transfer control of these services to Indigenous-led
							organizations. CIRNAC focuses on treaty negotiations,
							self-government agreements, land claims, and Northern affairs,
							aiming to strengthen nation-to-nation relationships and modernize
							Indigenous governance structures. Together, ISC and CIRNAC oversee
							key programs that impact Indigenous communities across Canada.
