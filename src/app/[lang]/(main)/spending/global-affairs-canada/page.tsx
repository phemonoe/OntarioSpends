						<Trans>
							Global Affairs Canada (GAC) is the federal department responsible
							for managing Canada's diplomatic relations, international trade,
							and development assistance. Established in 1909 as the Department
							of External Affairs, GAC has evolved to oversee Canada's
							engagement in global affairs, promoting national interests abroad
							and ensuring the protection of Canadian citizens overseas. The
							department negotiates international agreements, administers trade
							policies, and provides humanitarian aid. Additionally, it supports
							Canadian businesses in expanding internationally and strengthens
							diplomatic ties through multilateral organizations like the United
							Nations, the World Trade Organization (WTO), and NATO. GAC also
							plays a critical role in crisis response, assisting Canadians
							abroad during emergencies, and fostering global security and
							stability.
